# React + Redux Starterkit

The objective of this package is to serve as an educational template for developing applications with React and Redux.  Documentation is managed using [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/).  The documentation can be found in /docs/index.html.  The documentation should not be overlooked if the objective is to use this package for learning these technologies, because this is the only medium in which the information can be organized appropriately.  Both React and Redux are fairly complex technologies which require both (1) conceptual and (2) practical understanding in order to utilize them effectively.
