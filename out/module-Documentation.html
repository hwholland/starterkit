            <div class="description"><h3>Overview</h3><p>React is structured into small, modular units called components.  It's 
a new design approach which has benefits over traditional object-oriented
programming in today's world of micro-services and cloud computing.</p>
<h3>Key Concepts of React</h3><p>There are a few key concepts to understand about react:</p>
<ul>
<li>JavaScript and HTML are combined into a single file with extension 'jsx'.</li>
<li>Every React component has a &quot;render&quot; method that is expected to be included</li>
<li>The React framework handles the re-rendering of components based on something they call &quot;state&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Embedded Components</h3><p>In React, we can break apart our application into small, lightweight, components
that typically are organized based on the user-interface control hierarchy.
For instance, The MenuBar component is one that we have built and placed 
in our &quot;components&quot; folder.  Therefore, we can import any &quot;exported&quot; class 
from the index.jsx file within that folder.</p>
<p>To render one of the included components on the screen, you have to add an HTML 
tag with the name of that component (as defined by the import statement above), 
like so: </p>
<MenuBar/>

<h3>State</h3><p>Unlike traditional user-interface development, the values that are displayed on the screen
are not updated directly by changing a variable or property.  </p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with this approach, but when the application gets large it can be 
difficult to manage all of the different things that have to change frequently on the screen
based on certain events.  If you have an event that occurs in five different places of an
application, and the result of that event is for the header of every page to update it's 
text value - then you need to manually change the headers in five different places of your code.
Alternatively, you have to build a small library that updates the text, and reference that 
library in each of the five places.</p>
<p>React introdues something called &quot;state&quot;.  Basically, what this means is that each component
(or UI object) manages it's own properties and values.  And instead of you physically updating
those values, you define the conditions by which they will change &quot;state&quot;.  Then all you have to do
is trigger those conditions, and each of the objects will automatically update their own state; thus
changing their values.</p></div>
