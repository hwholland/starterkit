/**
 * ### Overview 
 * This class serves as the center-point for an application's code-base.
 * React is structured into small, modular units called components.  It's 
 * a new design approach which has benefits over traditional object-oriented
 * programming in today's world of micro-services and cloud computing.
 * 
 * ### Key Concepts of React
 * There are a few key concepts to understand about react:
 * * JavaScript and HTML are combined into a single file with extension 'jsx'.
 * * Every React component has a "render" method that is expected to be included
 * * The React framework handles the re-rendering of components based on something they call "state"
 * 
 * ### Embedded Components
 * In React, we can break apart our application into small, lightweight, components
 * that typically are organized based on the user-interface control hierarchy.
 * For instance, The MenuBar component is one that we have built and placed 
 * in our "components" folder.  Therefore, we can import any "exported" class 
 * from the index.jsx file within that folder.
 * 
 * To render one of the included components on the screen, you have to add an HTML 
 * tag with the name of that component (as defined by the import statement above), 
 * like so: 
 * &lt;MenuBar/>
 * 
 * @class App
 */

    /**
     * State is an optional object defined as a property of a React component.  
     * The State contains the variables you will reference in your jsx code.
     * In order to let the React framework handle the re-rendering correctly, you never change state properties directly, but through a method called setState() which is part of the base component that every React class extends
     * 
     * @member state
     * @memberof App

  /**
   * Inside the render method, you call your return statement, embedding the jsx code to be rendered by the browser.  
   * You can references variables within the jsx code by putting the variable name inside curly braces {}
   * 
   * CSS can be applied via class/className properties on HTML tags in the jsx code, and can reference theme libraries
   * either manually defined in a .css file, or imported via a node module.
   * 
   * @method render
